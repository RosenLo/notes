# [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

**Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

```
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
```
